# Can't Drink and Drive

This repository contains all the software resources required for this project to work.

This project is a brain child of 5 engineering students who wanted to minise road accidents due to drunk and underaged driving.

1) The project uses the driver's driving licence to check the drivers eligibilty, if eligible it lights up a yellow light.
2) The driver is prompted to breathe into an alcohol sensor to check if the driver is drowsy.
3) If the alcohol quantities is within the safe limits. It shows a green light and allows the driver to drive the car.
4) If the driver fails in any of the above checks, a red LED lights up, warning the driver of the catastrophic outcomes.

## Possible Use Cases:

- Barring people from claiming insurance money who got into an accident, even they were warned by the machine.
